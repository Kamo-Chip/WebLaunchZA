Advertisements are a great way to generate buzz and interest around your business, and ad services recognise this, which is why they charge big bucks for it.

These prices are not very practical when operating on a tight budget, so does this mean that your hopes of advertising on Google are pointless? Of course not. There's a free option to get your business seen on Google. Yes free. It's called a Google Business Profile. 

## What is a google business profile?

"Hold on. What exactly is a Google Business Profile?" I hear you asking. A Google Business Profile is simply a way for your business to get noticed on Google, and in turn, get more customers. It displays your business when someone searches on Google for services/products that you provide. For example, when a customer searches something like "Home builder near me" they would get the following results:

*Results of searching "home builder near me from our location*

These results are dependent on the customer's location. A construction company based in Durban would not be displayed if the customer is searching from Gauteng, so Google Business Profiles are a way to advertise your business within a local area. You specify your locations and the areas you serve, which tells Google who to show your profile. 

## You get to show the best of your business

But what makes the Google Business Profile great is that it gives you control over potential customers' first impressions of your business. Through the profile, you create a hub of information for your business. Returning to the previous example of "Home builder near me", if we click on one of the options we got from the search, we get access to a lot of information about the business, such as operating hours, links to the website, contact details, photos, reviews and much more.

This way customers form an opinion regarding your business. Now there is a lot more to discuss here, but for convenience's sake, if you wish to learn more about this, contact us for a free consultation about the Google Business Profile and how it can help your business. 

## How to get it to rank

In terms of getting the profile seen, a lot of work goes in behind that. Most business owners do not have time to dedicate to their profile while also focusing on the most important parts of their business, which is why, at MakersDev, we provide Google Business Profile setup and management services, so that you can focus on what you do best, and rank high without any extra effort on your end.

MakersDev has made it easy for us to get great results from our profile without having to do any of the work ourselves."
