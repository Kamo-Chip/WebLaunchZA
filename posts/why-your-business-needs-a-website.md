Gone are the days of putting up posters on streetlight poles, and thinking that that is enough to get customers. To ensure your business's success in today’s climate you need to have a solid online presence. There are numerous reasons why you may be hesitant to get a website. Perhaps you feel that you are not tech-savvy enough or that it's too costly (at [MakersDev](https://makers-dev-next.vercel.app/) our pricing is specifically tailored for small to medium-sized businesses, so you will not worry about cost when dealing with us).
Regardless of your hesitation, the fact remains that a website has a massive impact on your business’s success. These are the top 4 reasons why you need a website:

## Customers use Google to find products/services

Put yourself in the shoes of the customer. Business A and B both sell similar products, but business A does not have a website, and business B does. Why would you buy from business A when the competitor is more established? There is no reason to do so. In fact, despite selling similar products, business B will be more successful than A. 

A website increases a business’s credibility and builds trust between customers and the business. 
We know that people are more likely to spend money on products/services from businesses they trust. 
Customers are getting smarter with how they spend their money, so you need to become more convincing in getting them to spend their money on you. Having a website can drastically improve your ability to generate more revenue, and it is one of the few business expenses that have a fantastic return on investment. 

## A website sets you apart from your competition

Something great for your business is that not many businesses in South Africa have a good website. There is no greater opportunity to stand out from your competition than to get a website today. Getting a website gives you control over what potential customers think of your business. Branding is crucial because it leaves a lasting impression of your business in the customer's mind.

## A website enables you to reach more customers

Your business is limited by the number of potential customers it has access to (there are only so many streetlights in your vicinity to put posters on). If you only operate locally from a physical location, the number of customers you can reach is restricted. A website, on the other hand, connects you to anyone with internet access all over the country and beyond.

The number of internet users in South Africa is rapidly growing. Meaning that the number of your potential customers is increasing, but you will only be able to leverage this growth by getting a website.

## A website saves you time and increases your productivity

Many businesses get calls from customers asking simple questions about things such as location and hours of operation. If you miss a call, the customer is left unhappy. Calls can also distract you and your staff from focusing on the most important parts of your business. A website can reduce these basic calls and increase internal productivity. At the same time, it helps customers find useful information without needing to call and ensures that any calls that your business receives will be from more informed serious customers. 

A website is an integral part of today's successful businesses. Streetlight pole advertising could only get you so far. A website provides a vast amount of upside for your business
